                        </h3>
                        <p>

                            Hövding is an invisible helmet that is worn like a collar around your neck. When it senses shock, it releases a white helmet made from an ultra-strong nylon fabric that wraps around your head for protection, while leaving the field for vision open.  The collar device inflates with a gas that is also know as a cold gas inflator, which uses helium and later deflates within 10 seconds after impact.

                            Every year approximately 30,000 people are injured in bicycling accidents, resulting in about 40 deaths in Sweden alone. Many riders choose to not wear a helmet because of fear of looking “stupid” and not wanting to mess up their hair or style.

                            Originally started with over 7 years of research and tests on practice dummies. Hovding works through a series of sensors and algorithms and have developed a way to distinguish normal cycling from accidents. In current marketing they reach this audience through fashion runway shows and using their product in a more fashionable sense.
